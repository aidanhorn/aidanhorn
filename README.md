I work for [Codera Analytics](https://codera.co.za/who-we-are/), where I am a data engineer. I mainly use R, and also
Python, SQL, and a bit of CSS and HTML. I am also proficient with LaTeX and Stata, though those are more academic languages.
I use Ubuntu GUI on both my laptop and desktop (I haven't subscribed to Microsoft Office since 2023). I first started using
Linux around 2017.
